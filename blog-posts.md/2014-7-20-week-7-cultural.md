The Value of Values
-------------------

It's taken me a while to figure out who I am, and I'm still discovery how to deal with myself but I've come a long way. If I think back about what makes me feel best about myself, it has to self-reliance. I love being able to figure out and do things myself. It makes me feel great to be able to take on tasks, figure them out and learn something in the process.


If I hate to rate how I live up to some of the values I find important, it'd go something like this:  

  - Accomplishment - 3
  - Adventure - 3
  - Excitement - 3
  - Personal Development - 4
  - Self-Reliance - 5
  - Honesty - 5


I believe I do my best to live up to these values, but I don't always succeed. For example, I got into a rut for a while and didn't really accomplish much. I've always had a job, and haven't had much trouble getting by but I definitely haven't accomplished what I'd imagined when I was younger.
