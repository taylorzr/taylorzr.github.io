Wireframing My Favorite Sites
-----------------------------

[Google Search](http://www.google.com)
--------------------------------------

Google search is solving the problem of finding stuff on the internets. The visual challenges are arranging the multitude of varied data in a way that makes sense. I think it does a great job. For items it can, it displays the *answer* front and center. It also displays information about the item in the sidebar. And all the related search results follow.


[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com)
---------------------------------

YouTube is solving the problem of sharing your videos with the rest of the world. It allows any person to easily share a video, from my cat failing a jump, to a fully produced show arguing for change. Visually, it's bit cluttered but gets the job done. All suggested vidoes and subscribed channels are listed and easy to scan through.


[Google Keep](http://www.keep.google.com)
--------------------------------------

Keep solves the problem of simple note taking. For me, it's exactly what I need, simple notes, and checklists. Because notetaking is a bit simpler than displaying search results for everything in the universe, or displaying videos and all their related content, I think it worked out better visually. It's very clean and elegeant.
