SQL vs NoSQL
------------

It's mildly difficult to write about the advantages and disadvantages of SQL vs NoSQL databases but I find this topic very interesting. However, even to a newbie there are some differences that seem like they'll be significant.

The difference between SQL and NoSQL is like the difference between static and dynamic programming languages. In a staic programming language, an object is created with specific type, and in SQL databases columns are created with specific types. If you try to assign a string object an integer value, the compiler will raise an error. With SQL databases, if you try to insert an integer value into a string column, the database will raise an error.

In a dynamic programming language, objects have a type but aren't restricted to maintaining that type. Similarly, NoSQL databases typically don't have a specific data type for each column. They don't even have to have columns. Data storage in NoSQL databases is much more flexible. Data can be stored hierarchically which can often fit data types much better than rigid SQL database tables.

That's not to say that SQL doesn't have it's advantages. SQL is a widely popular database format. The query language is standardized and users typically have little trouble moving their query skills from one SQL database to another. Whereas most NoSQL databases are a new and evolving technology and each use different query languages to access data.

At this point, I've had a little experience with SQL databases but I'm really looking forward to trying out some NoSQL databases. I love the appeal of flexibility especially while learning how to code. This benefit seems to be very important. With SQL databases, you need to take the database offline and update the strict table definitions to allow different data types. Beyond learning, flexibility seems like a great benefit as our applications are constantly changing and evolving.

I'm excited to see NoSQL databases mature and possibly incorporate a standardized query language that would allow users to migrate between different database vendors easily. Only time will tell, both in my understanding and NoSQL's developments
