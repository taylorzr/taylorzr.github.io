						<h1>Problems in Wonderland</h1>
					</header>

					<section>
						<p>One big problem in the tech world is regulation. Technology is evolving quicker than we can imagine, but it's coming up against a slow if not unmoving giant. There are many problems that technology can solve, but sometimes governments aren't ready for the solution.</p>
                        
                        <p>For example, Lyft and Uber have both made it easy for people with cars to offer a ride. But some cities, especially those that charge 1 million dollars or more aren't going to make it that easy. There is just no way you can not make waves creating an alternative to a business that takes a million dollar buy in.</p>
                        
                        <p>I can drive, give a friend a ride. I'm assuming I can legally accept $20 for gas, but the moment I pickup a stranger and do the same, I'm a criminal? Hmn. I know driving can be dangerous, but why do we need the government to get involved? If you don't think it's safe enough for you, don't use it.</p>
                        
                        <p>Technology is making it easier for amateurs to become professionals. And these amateurs are being exposed to the ridiculousness of regulation. Hopefully, a little exposure, and a bit of self-determinism will make people think and question if we really need these regulations.</p>
