						<h1>OOF: Object-Oriented versus Functional</h1>
					</header>

					<section>
						<p>Programming is a process of describing a series of instructions. There are at least two ways to conceptualize this process, object-oriented and functional. Object oriented programming is primarily concerned with things, whle functional programming is primarily concerned with actions.
						</p>

						<p>For example, with object-oriented programming you would group code into things, or classes:</p>
						<p><code>
							class Human <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp def eat <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp puts "Mmm bacon" <br>
						        &nbsp&nbsp end <br>
					        end <br>
					        <br>
							class Human<br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp def eat <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp puts "Mmm bacon" <br>
						        &nbsp&nbsp end <br>
					        end <br>
				        </code></p>

				        <p>With functional programming, you would groups code into actions, or functions/methods.<p>
				        <p><code>
							def eat_as_a(thing) <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp if thing == "human" <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp puts "Mmm bacon" <br>
						        &nbsp&nbsp end <br>
						        <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp if thing == "cat" <br>
							    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp puts "Mmm dry cardboard" <br>
						        &nbsp&nbsp end <br>						        
					        end <br>
				        </code></p>

				        <p>Calling the class method or function is relatively simple either way: 
				        <p><code>
							# Object-Oriented Programming <br>
				        	Human.new.eat # => "Mmm bacon" <br> 
			        		Cat.new.eat # => "Mmm dry cardboard<br> 
							<br> 
				        	# Functional Programming <br>
			        		eat_as_a("human") # => "Mmm bacon" <br> 
			        		eat_as_a("cat") # => "Mmm dry cardboard" <br> 
		        		</code></p>

		        		<p>With either style, the same result is achieved, the humans eats bacon and the cat eats dry cardboard (poor little kitty). But the process to achieve the result is different.</p>

		        		<p>In my experience, I find object-oriented programming easier to understand. It seems to model my thinking style where I first think of a thing, and then think of what that thing can do. And that's the way I think about the world, so it's natural for me.<p>

	        			<p>However, both styles have their place. The appropirate style would depend on the task at hand. If your problem is primarily a challenge of actions, then functional programming would clearly be the better choice. But if your challenge is primarily using things, then object-oriented programming would be preferential.</p>
