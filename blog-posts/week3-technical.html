						<h2>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h2>
							
						<p>The obvious first, it's there. It's included by default in all modern browsers. Javscript has a complex and fractured history, but this simple fact is the reason it's so popular today. Just as Internet Explorer was popular, and unfortunately still is, because it was the default. While Internet Explorer got comfortable, put it's feet up and relaxed while Firefox and Chrome surpassed it. Javascript has avoided being bad enough to make users create or choose something else.</p>

						<p>On top of being there, it's also relatively easy to use.</p>
