						<h1>JavaScript</h1>

						<h2>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</h2>
							
						<p>The obvious first, <strong>it's there</strong>. It's included by default in all modern browsers. Javscript has a complex and fractured history, but this simple fact is the reason it's so popular today. Just as Internet Explorer was popular, and unfortunately still is, because it was the default. While Internet Explorer got comfortable, put it's feet up and relaxed, Javascript has avoided being bad enough to make users create or choose something else.</p>
						
						<p>Besides JavaScript being there, <strong>it solves a problem</strong>. HTML and CSS is rather static without scripting. But adding JavaScript makes web pages dynamic, and creates a much better user experience. The web has exploded in popularity and you must create a good user experience if you want your web page or application to be successful.</p>

						<h2>What are the great things about JavaScript</h2>

						<p>It's relatively <strong>easy to use</strong>. It's mostly object orientented, which means you program using things, just as you would work with things in the real world. It is a dynamically typed language, which means variables aren't bound to a type. It is also a weakly typed language, which means the interpreter will convert variable types implicitly instead of raising an error.</p>

						<p>These design features, in my opinion, make writing and reading code very clear. It's fast to read, write and reasonably fast to execute. It also has lots of sweet libraries, such as jquery, that make using it much more efficient and easy.</p>

						<h2>What are it's limitations?</h2>

						<p>JavaScript excecution in the browser is limited to the <strong>client-side only.</strong> This means it can ask the server for data, but it can't access the data directly. It can play with stuff the server has already provided, but if you need more stuff, JavaScript has to ask the server for the stuff. So you need an entirely different system to handle the server side operations, adding complexity to any web project.</p>
