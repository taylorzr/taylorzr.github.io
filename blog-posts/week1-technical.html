		<h1>These are few of my favorite websites, and I think I'm a Google fanboy...</h1>

		<p>I had a little trouble thinking of my three favorite websites. I’m often browsing the internets, so that’s no the problem. I think it’s because I use and like many different websites, but don’t really have too many strong favorites. As long as the content is there, I can forgive the experience and design.</p>

		<h2>Google Search</h2>

		<p>The internets, and the way to find stuff on the internets has absolutely revolutionized life. As a naturally inquisitive mind, through search I can find an answer that random thought, or learn how to do almost anything.</p>

		<p>The experience of Google search is unmatched. For example, searching for “Chicago Blackhawks” returns 7,500,000. in 0.58 seconds. As it’s the end of the season for the Blackhawks, I’m shown a list of the previous games with their rival and score. There is a sidebar with detailed information about the Blackhawks. The number of results returned is a bit ridiculous. I mean, I’m never getting past the 3rd page of results, but if I want to spend the rest of my life scrolling, there’s at least the option.</p>

		<p>And it’s more than just the Google search website. The omnibox in chrome means you can immediately search in your browser, just type and go. You can do math in the search field, which I’ve used to show my roommate he’s dead wrong about the <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=(60mph+%2B+5mph)(1%2B(60mph*5mph)%2Fc**2)**-1+in+mph" target="_blank">speed of someone riding a unicycle on a train, or something</a>. You can define words quickly <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%20mantis" target="_blank">for example</a>. And much more I’m sure I’m forgetting.</p>

		<p>Yet, I think the design is ugly. The logo looks like a alphabet soup fell out of a pinata. The red navigation elements, blue links, and green addresses stick with the theme, but it doesn’t look good. It’s a bit cluttered, especially when you’re logged in and have your Google profile at the top right on top of everything else. But in the end it doesn’t really matter, because despite how the data is painted, it’s fast and easy to scan, read and find what you’re looking for. And that’s the point.</p>

		<h2>YouTube</h2>

		<p>The YouTube experience for me is twofold. There is search, for when I’m looking for something specific, and there is my feed, for when I want to explore. Basically, all the same points of Google search apply to YouTube search. The “What to watch” feed is a bit different. It moves YouTube from just a video search engine, to a mini-television. It does a great job suggesting videos, display subscribed channels, and simply playing video with the potential to waste countless hours watching cats and car wrecks.</p>

		<p>The design of YouTube feels a bit cluttered. I think it comes down to not being enough white space. I’ve frequently scanned right past some video or channel I was looking for. It’s very similar to the Google search design, but for some reason I don’t think it’s as ugly. Maybe the screenshots of each video help.</p>

	<section id="keep">

		<h2>Google Keep</h2>

		<p>Although Google Keep has earned a bronze medal in my web olympics, I think the experience and design is the best of the bunch. It takes runner up to Google search and YouTube because although it’s useful, it’s not as important to me as the other two.</p>

		<p>The experience is exactly what I’m looking for, simple note taking and task lists. I’m super forgetful, so I have to make lists to remind myself to get something done. The lists are store in the cloud, accessible from a desktop or phone and very easy to use.</p>

		<p>Keep looks great, it’s clean and simple. It doesn’t feel ugly or cluttered like Google search or YouTube.</p>
