						<h1>The Stereotype Threat</h1>
					</header>

					<section>
						<p>I find the stereotype threat very interesting despite not really believing I've been negatively affected by sterotyping. The only thing I can think of is that I was always a short scrawny kid. In my childhood, I guess this was a difference significant enough to outcast me. I associated with other outcasts, nerdy, weird and different despite being a typical "priviledged" white kid.</p>

						<p>However, I don't believe that stereotyping affected my performance in any negative way. If anything it made me try harder. As a short scrawny little punk, I wasn't expected to perform well in sports. Yet, I played on a select soccer team for years, and played basketball with my friends. I wasn't half bad and could keep up the game despite my height deficiency.</p>

						<p>Had I took the perspective that not much was expected of me, so I should accept failure or lesser performance, I wouldn't have perfomed as well. I think this is what the stereotype threat boils down to. The threat is people accept performance based on how they believe others perceive their abilitites. I don't know if it is a generational difference, or what but I've never felt that my performance should be based on what others think of me.</p>

						<p>Yet, there are apparently numerous studies showing this effect is real and measurable. The discussion tends to focus on minorities or women but I believe that distracts from the more general principle. Despite your minority status, a negative group association may effect your performance. I can understand the concept, if you aren't expected to perform, you'll be more likely to not try as hard. I just don't get it personally, if you tell me I'm not up to a challenge I find important, I'm going to prove you wrong.</p> 

						<p>The thing I found most important on how to deal with this problem is feedback. The common recipe for feedback, say something nice and then say what you really mean, is ineffective. The most important part is not something positive, then something critical, but afterwards saying that I believe you can do better, you just have to work at it. I'll try to keep this in mind whenever I approach such a situation as it seems an important recipe for the success of any individual.</p>

						<p>However, I really see this problem as an attitude problem. You don't become successful in life by just trying to meet perceived expectations. You become successful by exceling through hard word despite expectations. It's not enough to meet expectations if you perceive them as low, you should be trying as hard as you can regardless.<p>
