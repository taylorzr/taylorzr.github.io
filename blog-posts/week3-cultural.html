								<li><strong>28 points - Concrete Sequential</strong> tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.</li>
								<li><strong>8 points - Abstract Random</strong> organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments</li>

						<h2>Biggest struggle so far related to how I learn, or something else?</h2>

						<p>The 2nd week of HTML-CSS was the hardest for me. I'm working 40-50 hours a week, and have a variety of personal responsibilities outside of work, but I don't really think completing the 2nd week was fully a time problem.</p>

						<p>I like design to a point, but then start hating it. I would have said I have a full-on growth mindset, but I realized that when it comes to design, I switch to a fixed mindset. I start to avoid the challenge, I put it off and tell myself I just don't like design.</p>

						<p>I need to recognize I approach challenges depending on the task. When it comes to design, I need to break down the challenge into smaller pieces, solve the problems one at a time, and take breaks. Timeboxing, focusing on one task for a short period of time, really helped. So did trying to eliminate distractions, putting on headphones, and going to a coffeeshop.</p>

						<h2>Ways to expand the way I learn and think?</h2>

						<p>I learn best when I have time to experiment by myself. I like to just try something, and see how it works. I think about it, try to conceptualize what is happenging and try again. When I get stuck, I refer to references and documentation. But I'd like to challenge myself to try experiences I'm not comfortable with.</p>

						<p>I've already done this to some degree, but I'd like to continue. I can definitely expand my knowledge and understanding by peer pairing. I can also try to realize when my mindset switches, and use learning strategies to solve the problem, not avoid it.</p>
