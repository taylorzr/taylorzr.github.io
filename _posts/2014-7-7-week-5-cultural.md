Peer Pairing
------------

I definitely see a benefit of peer pairing, especially from a perspective of communication. It's hard to discuss how to solve challenges, and adding all the terminology of multiple programming languages doesn't make it any easier. I see pairing as a great tool to develop the ability to communicate effectively.

But I'm not sold on peer pairing to solve problems. I'm not sure if I'm still getting used to it, or if my mind just doesn't work very well while partnering. I feel uncomfortable, and not at my best. I don't really feel the same sense of accomplishment as I do when solving problems myself. And the differences in coding experience make pairing completely different every time.

One of my last pairings, I struggled. I think it was partially because I had a busy couple days with almost no sleep. I wasn't listening enough, and the communication broke down. The feedback was honest, and certainly helpful. It's weird though, whenever you receive constructive feedback, there's always a slight feeling of being offended even when it's entirely true.

When it comes to writing feedback, I struggle as well. Most of the time, I have a general feeling of how the pairing went, but I can't think of specifics. I don't really know what to say. I hope that giving feedback will come easier with experience, but so far it's been tough.

But I'm not giving up yet, I'll keep trying. Maybe this is just one area where I need to grow. Regardless of the struggles, just talking with other people in the program is very comforting and rewarding itself.
