Problems in Wonderland
----------------------
One big problem in the tech world is regulation. Technology is evolving quicker than we can imagine, but it's coming up against a slow if not unmoving giant. There are many problems that technology can solve, but sometimes governments aren't ready for the solution.

For example, Lyft and Uber have both made it easy for people with cars to offer a ride. But some cities, especially those that charge 1 million dollars or more aren't going to make it that easy. There is just no way you can not make waves creating an alternative to a business that takes a million dollar buy in.

I can drive, give a friend a ride. I'm assuming I can legally accept $20 for gas, but the moment I pickup a stranger and do the same, I'm a criminal? Hmn. I know driving can be dangerous, but why do we need the government to get involved? If you don't think it's safe enough for you, don't use it.

Technology is making it easier for amateurs to become professionals. And these amateurs are being exposed to the ridiculousness of regulation. Hopefully, a little exposure, and a bit of self-determinism will make people think and question if we really need these regulations.
