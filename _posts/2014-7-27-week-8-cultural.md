It's a Hard Knock Life
----------------------

So... Life's been a bit crazy recently. Just like the rest of my devbootcampers, I recently made the decision to quit my job and jump head first into starting a new career, but it doesn't stop there. I got married in April, and shortly after my wife's 16 year old son moved away from his father, and into our home.

He wasn't getting along with his father, and wasn't doing well in school. When he moved in, we laid down some basic rules and at first everything went fairly well. He was respectful and started doing a little better in school, but there were, and definitely still are some deep emotional problems. One day a month or so in, he just blew up, told my wife off and said he was moving out. It was a shock to us and came completely out of the blue.

There is no doubt he has a right to be upset about the hardships in his life, but this outburst was completely uncalled for and we took it personally. We all ingnored the situation for a few days and then tried to talk to him, but it didn't go well. Whenever we made a reasoned argument about why he should live with us, or why he can't move out, he just shut down.

So about a week later, we got together with his father and step-mother. We had a long, long talk/intervention about how he was behaving. It was hard, just like before he completely shut down. I don't think he felt like he was loved, but after we all explained that we cared, and showed that we do everything we can for him, he came around. I think he realized living with us was the best thing for him right now.

So while reading about the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf) a lightbulb went off when I came upon coping by withdrawal. It's clear that he doesn't believe that he is loved, and he can't deal with criticism. So the shame hits him hard and he runs away from it, literally. I don't expect it to be easy, and I'm not sure if he's going to improve but I think the best thing we can do is continue to openly communicate while trying to express we care.
