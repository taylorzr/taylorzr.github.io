My thinking style
-----------------

I'm an loner rebel experiementer who loves the world of theory and abstract thought:

  - **48 points - Abstract Sequential** love the world of theory and abstract thought.
  - **36 points - Concrete Random** are experimenters.
  - **28 points - Concrete Sequential** tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.
  - **8 points - Abstract Random** organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments


Biggest struggle so far?
------------------------

The 2nd week of HTML-CSS was the hardest for me. I'm working 40-50 hours a week, and have a variety of personal responsibilities outside of work, but I don't really think completing the 2nd week was fully a time problem.

I like design to a point, but then start hating it. I would have said I have a full-on growth mindset, but I realized that when it comes to design, I switch to a fixed mindset. I start to avoid the challenge, I put it off and tell myself I just don't like design.

I need to recognize I approach challenges depending on the task. When it comes to design, I need to break down the challenge into smaller pieces, solve the problems one at a time, and take breaks. Timeboxing, focusing on one task for a short period of time, really helped. So did trying to eliminate distractions, putting on headphones, and going to a coffeeshop.


Ways to expand the way I learn and think?
-----------------------------------------

I learn best when I have time to experiment by myself. I like to just try something, and see how it works. I think about it, try to conceptualize what is happenging and try again. When I get stuck, I refer to references and documentation. But I'd like to challenge myself to try experiences I'm not comfortable with.

I've already done this to some degree, but I'd like to continue. I can definitely expand my knowledge and understanding by peer pairing. I can also try to realize when my mindset switches, and use learning strategies to solve the problem, not avoid it.
