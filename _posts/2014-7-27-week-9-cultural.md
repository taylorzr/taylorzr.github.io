If my answers frighten you, then you should cease asking scary questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some say there are no stupid questions, and while they may be correct, some questions are certainly better than others. It's not the problem itself that is the issue, it's the way the question of how to solve the problem is communicated. So what makes a good question?

1. Context
You need to start with context. Describe your environment, things like the operating system you're using, the languages, and the versions. Context also includes a summary of what you're trying to achieve. Providing context let's other put themselves in your shoes and understand what your trying to achieve, and what problems you're having. 

2. Examples
After setting up the context, you need to provide example(s). This doesn't mean you paste 200 lines of poorly indented ruby code. You should reduce the problem to the smallest example you can imagine. I would guess half the time, if you simplify the problem, you'll probably figure it out on your own. 

3. Ease
Overall, you should do everything you can to make the question easy to answer. This primarily means making your example simple. But it also includes providing a fully working example, and better yet a link to a web service that runs the code.

A Bad Question?
---------------
So, let's take a look a [bad question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10222836/open-another-pop-up-when-one-popup-ok-button-is-clicked): 

> Open another pop-up when one popup ok button is clicked.
> any help guys?

Ouch, we've got some issues here. There is absolutely no context besides the stack-overflow tags. All we know if that the problem is somehow related to javascript, ruby, rails or jquery. There is also no example code, not even a reference to another example. Finally, it's not going to be easy to answer this question. We'd have to guess what the problem is, and what needs to be accomplished.

So how could we make this better? The new question provides context, and example and a link to code that "runs":

> I'm using javascript to present an alert to a user. After the user acknowledges the alert I want to present another alert. How would I do this?
> I can display an alert to the user by calling `alert("Howdy partner");` but I tried [this](http://jsfiddle.net/Z936e/) and it's not working. I expected two alerts, but I'm only getting one. How can I solve this? 

I think asking questions clearly comes down to the platinum rule. **Treat others as they would like to be treated.** If you're asking a question, you need think about it from their perspective and do everything you can to make it possible and easy for your peer to answer.
