The Beginning
-------------
The Devbootcamp experience sounds exciting and a bit frightening. I'm definitely and introvert, especially when it comes to working. I prefer to work and think alone, so I'll probably struggle a bit with the social challenges in devbootcamp. But this is one of the main reasons I decided to participate, so I'm ready to be uncomfortable.

I've been coding python off and on for about 5 years, and I thought coding and learning would be easier than I'm realizing it will be. I'm definitely nervous, I knew it was going to be hard, but I think it's going to be harder than I expected. Yet, this is a good thing, I want to be pushed harder than I've been before.
