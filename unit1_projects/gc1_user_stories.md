I want to be able calculate the sum of any list of numbers. 
------------------------------------------------------------
  
  > For any list of numbers, all of the numbers should be added together and I should get the result.
  
  > For example, if I have a list of numbers "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7", I would add all the numbers together and  get the result of 27. 
  
  > Or if I have a list of numbers "4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7", I would add all the numbers together and get the result of 43.


I also want to be able to calculate the mean of any list of numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  > For any list of numbers, all of the numbers should be added together, and divided by the quantity of numbers in the list.
  
  > For example, if I had list of numbers "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7", I would add all the numbers together resulting in 27. I would count the quanitity of numbers in the list getting 7. Then I would divided 27 by 7 and get the result of 3.857142857142857.
  
  > Or if I had a list of numbers "4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7", I would add all the numbers together resulting in 43. I would count the quanitity of numbers in the list getting 8. Then I would divide 43 by 8 and get the result of 5.375.


Finally I want to be able to calculate the median of any list of numbers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  > For any list of numbers, the value at the middle of the list should be calculated.
  
  > For example, if I have a list of numbers "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7", which has an odd quantity of numbers, I would divided the quantity of numbers in the list by 2, getting 3.5. I would round 3.5 to 4, and the median would be the 4th number in the list, which would be 4.
  
  > Or if I have a list of numbers "4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7", which has an even quantity of numbers, I would divide the quantity of numbers in the list by 2, getting 4. I would then divide the 4th number in the list by the 5th number in the list. So I would calculate 5 divided by 6, and get the result of 5.5.
